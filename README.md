- 👋 Hi, I’m @HedyMercury
- 👀 I’m interested in blue team mostly I guess. Currently okay with C++ basics, minute experience with Java, and taking on Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently getting my Bachelor's degree in compsci, going through TryHackMe paths and online courses in security and programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to increase my skillset so that I am feared by all
- 📫 How to reach me ... whistle at night and I will come
- 😄 Pronouns: anything respectful
- ⚡ Fun fact: All my facts are very serious
